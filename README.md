Description:

testAL1.m ï¼š 		main function

SBLIBP.m :          function of our algorithm

%%%%%%

We provide the following simulated array received signals with two SNRs for algorithm verification.

1. receivedArrayData0dB.mat :  	Simulated array received data with 0dB SNR

2. receivedArrayData-5dB.mat : Simulated array received data with -5dB SNR

YUsed: array received data with size of  M* T* fft_num_use, 

where  

				M: the number of array elements.
                          
			    T:  the number of snapshots
                          
				fft_num_use:  the number of frequency points. The monitored frequency band is 400-2000 Hz

Signal parameters and array parameters have been shown in testAL1.m or the paper.
